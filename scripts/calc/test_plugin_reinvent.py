"""Tests for the REINVENT 4 plugin's worker (src-tauri/resources/plugins/reinvent/worker.py).

The worker needs REINVENT 4 and its prior: these run in the plugin's own
environment, installed from its lock, with the prior in the folder the app
keeps the plugin's files in (or the one MENO_REINVENT_FILES names):

    <the REINVENT 4 plugin's Python> -m unittest scripts/calc/test_plugin_reinvent.py

(The app's environment for it, under its data folder at
uv/plugin-reinvent/venv, will do.) Elsewhere they are skipped: the
environment is about a gigabyte, too much for every push.
