"""Each entry's charge and spin multiplicity through the step plugins' workers:
a property, over seeded random sets of small molecules (docs/WORKFLOWS.md,
*What changes in the contract*).

For any set of entries - mixed charges and spins - each worker's `prepare`
writes every entry's charge and multiplicity into its program's input, in
that program's own syntax as the worker implements it, and never another
entry's; where its `collect` builds output entries, each keeps its own. A
combination its electrons cannot have is refused, or written as it was
given - never changed.

The xTB, CREST, ORCA and Gaussian workers need Python alone, so these run
anywhere:

    python3 -m unittest scripts/calc/test_charge_multiplicity.py

RDKit's needs RDKit: its tests are skipped without it, and run in the
plugin's own environment (its venv's python, as above).

What each program is asked is checked against the syntax its worker's
docstring cites: xtb's and CREST's `--chrg` and `--uhf` (unpaired
electrons, the multiplicity less one), ORCA's `* xyz charge multiplicity`,
Gaussian's charge and multiplicity on the molecule specification's first
line. The programs' outputs below are short, written as those workers'
own tests write them; no output of a real run is kept.
