"""The RDKit plugin's worker: RDKit, answering a fixed set of requests - the
roles it fills for Meno (its manifest; docs/PLUGINS.md).

One JSON object per line on stdin, one per line back on stdout:

    {"id": 7, "op": "to_smiles", "molblock": "..."}
    {"id": 7, "ok": true, "result": {"smiles": "CCO"}}
    {"id": 7, "ok": false, "error": "..."}

It runs no code it is sent - only the operations below - and needs no
network. When RDKit has been imported it says so:

    {"event": "ready", "version": "2026.03.6"}

Structures come in as MOL blocks, V2000 or V3000, and go back as V3000 ones
with their atoms in the order they came in. (Clean-up is Meno's own layout
engine's, in the app: src/lib/layout.) Their 3D structures go back as
atoms, bonds and coordinates: the atoms in the order they came in, the
hydrogens made for them after.

It also fills kinds of a workflow's step (docs/WORKFLOWS.md, its
manifest's `steps`), given molecules in 3D as Meno gives a writer one -
each atom's element, place, charge and radical, the bonds by index:

- *Conformers*, as a job: `prepare` says what each job is - this folder's
  conformers_job.py, run by its environment's Python on the molecule
  written into the job's folder - and `collect` reads back what it wrote;
- *Duplicates*, at once (`run`): those alike within an RMSD over their
  heavy atoms, at their best over the molecule's symmetries, set aside.

# for one (it said "Unrecognized hybridization" for Pd, and with no terms for
# its bonds pushed it 8 to 25 A away or crashed). So a metal's bonds are given
# their covalent lengths, its ligands kept apart, and it is typed for UFF as a
# geometry UFF has for it; where UFF has none, nothing is optimised, and the
# chip says so.
