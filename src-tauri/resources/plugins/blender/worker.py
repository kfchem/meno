"""The Blender plugin's worker: pictures and films of molecules in 3D, rendered by Blender.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/RENDER.md), run in an environment
of its own - Python alone, no package. Blender itself, under its own
licence, is Meno's own copy of its official build, fetched beside the
environment as the plugin is set up (the manifest's `downloads`); a job
runs it from there.
One JSON object per line each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "render", "entries": [{"scene": "scene.gltf", "film": false, "width": 2400, "height": 1600, "frames": 1, "fps": 1}], "options": {...}, "cores": 8}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "blender", "args": [...], "files": [...], "reads": []}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "render", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"made": [{"entry": 0, "file": "picture.png", "media": "image/png"}]}}

It fills the role Render, and runs nothing itself: `prepare` writes each
job's settings and its scripts, render.py and the interface's side of it
(presets.py), which Blender runs in its own Python - beside the scene Meno
writes into the job's folder (each entry's `scene`), and the files of a
preset plugin's look, studio or motion chosen (the entry's `presets`), which
Meno puts there (docs/plugins/blender-presets.md) - and says the command
Meno runs, apart from Meno, in the job's folder; `collect` says what the job made - a picture, a PNG, or a film,
an MP4 - or, where it failed, why. One job for each entry.

Blender is run as its manual says (docs.blender.org, Blender 5.2,
"Command Line Arguments"): in the background (-b), with its factory
settings and none of the chemist's own (--factory-startup), no sound
(-noaudio), never reaching the network (--offline-mode), as many threads
as Meno gives the job (-t), exiting with an error where the script fails
(--python-exit-code), running render.py (-P), its settings after "--".

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
