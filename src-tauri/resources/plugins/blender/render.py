"""Renders the scene Meno wrote - glTF 2.0 - as a picture or a film.

Run by Blender, in its own Python, as the job the plugin's worker prepared
(worker.py): Blender in the background, with its factory settings, this
script, and after "--" the job's settings, a JSON file in the job's folder:

    blender -b --factory-startup -noaudio --offline-mode --python-exit-code 1 -P render.py -- render.json

It is under the GPL, as a script using Blender's Python API is: a program
of its own, apart from Meno, which it speaks to only through the files in
the job's folder and its arguments (docs/PLUGINS.md, *Licences*).

What it does, by Blender's own manual and API reference (docs.blender.org,
Blender 5.2): it empties Blender's scene, takes in the glTF scene with
Blender's glTF importer (its camera, its key light, its materials - their
extensions too - and, for a film, its animation), lights the world evenly
as Meno's light all round is, sets the render engine, its samples and
noise removal, the colour transform and the background, and renders the
picture, or each frame of the film into a video - saying how far it is, a
line at a time: "progress <done>/<all>" - as hundredths of the whole, the samples of a
picture, or of each frame of a film, moving it, from Blender's own render statistics.

The settings (all checked by the worker that wrote them):

    scene       the glTF file's name, in the job's folder
    out         the name to write: a picture's (PNG) or a film's (MP4)
    film        a film, not a picture
    width, height, frames, fps
    engine      "cycles" or "eevee"
    samples, denoise
    device      "auto" - the faster of the graphics processor and the processor, found once by a timing and kept -, "gpu" or "cpu"
    background  "transparent", "white", "black" or "grey"
    colours     "neutral", "agx" or "standard"
    key, ambient   the key light's and the light all round's strengths, as factors of Meno's
    softness    how soft the shadows are: the key light's width, in degrees
    quality     a film's: "high", "medium" or "lossless"
    presets     where a preset plugin's look, studio or motion is chosen (docs/plugins/blender-presets.md): for each such
                plugin, which (`from`), the chosen ones' files (`look`, `studio`, `motion`) and its own options (`values`); its files
                are in the job's folder, under presets/<plugin id>/, put there by Meno
    mode        a film's: "once" or "loop"
    shading     "lit", as a renderer lights it, or "toon": each material a Toon BSDF in the colour it had,
                lit in one band - `band` its size - which Cycles draws as a band, without noise removal
    outlines    "none", "thin" (Freestyle's lines, one pixel), "outer" (the picture's silhouette grown
                by `outline` pixels) or "mixed" (both); `outline_colour`: "black", "white" or "grey"
