"""The xTB plugin's worker: steps of a workflow done with xtb, and xtb's
outputs read.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/WORKFLOWS.md), run in a pixi
environment of its own - xtb and Python from conda-forge. One JSON object
per line each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "xtb", "args": [...], "files": [...], "reads": [...]}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {...}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"outputs": [{...}]}}
    {"id": 6, "op": "read", "name": "run.out", "text": "..."}
    {"id": 6, "ok": true, "result": {...}}

It fills three kinds of step - Optimise, Energy, Frequencies - and runs
nothing itself: `prepare` says what each job is - its input, and the
command Meno runs, apart from Meno, in the job's folder - and `collect`
reads back what a job wrote, as Meno's own output form (lib/calc/output),
or says why it failed. One job for each entry. It reads xtb's outputs,
too - `read`, an output opened by hand - and a job's and an opened one's
are one reading (reader.py): `collect` reads a job's log with it, and adds
only what xtb wrote to files of its own and does not print - an
optimisation's path, and the geometry a run began with.

What xtb is asked is as xtb's own documentation has it
(xtb-docs.readthedocs.io: "Commandline Usage", "Geometry Optimization",
"Calculation of Vibrational Frequencies", "Implicit Solvation"):

- the input as Xmol (XYZ) coordinates in angstroms; `--chrg` the charge,
  `--uhf` the unpaired electrons; `--gfn 1`, `--gfn 2` or `--gfnff`;
  `--alpb` a solvent; `--opt` a level, or `--hess`; `-P` the cores;
- a lone atom - an ion of a salt, say - asked to be optimised is not:
  it has no geometry to optimise, and xtb stops with an error when asked
  to optimise one. Its energy is worked out where it is instead;
- an optimisation's path in `xtbopt.log`, Xmol frames whose comment line
  holds the total energy and the gradient norm, and its last geometry in
  `xtbopt.xyz`; whether it converged as xtb says it in its output (it
  writes `.xtboptok` whether it did or not);
- a run whose solvation, as its output says it, is not what was asked is
  refused.

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
