"""xtb's output, read: what the xtb program printed of one run, in Meno's
general form (src/lib/calc/output.ts, results.ts) - the one reading of it,
for an output opened by hand and for a job's alike. The worker's `read`
answers with it, and its `collect` reads a job's log with it and adds only
what xtb wrote to files of its own: an optimisation's path, and the
geometry a run began with, which xtb does not print.

Read from xtb's own documentation (xtb-docs.readthedocs.io: "Commandline
Usage", "Geometry Optimization", "Calculation of Vibrational Frequencies",
"Implicit Solvation", "Properties") and from what xtb 6.7.1 prints, and
from nothing else. Each pattern below quotes the printed form it reads,
its numbers made up. Python's standard library alone, and no file read: the
text is given.

What xtb prints, and where:
- its version in its banner; the method in its setup ("Hamiltonian
  GFN2-xTB"), or GFN-FF's own heading; the charge and the unpaired
  electrons in its setup, or - GFN-FF, which prints no such setup - the
  total charge of its summary;
- the atoms in the table of elements it prints as it begins, by their
  places ("1, 2", "5-7"); no coordinates, but for an optimisation's final
  structure, which it prints as it was given them (Xmol, or a Turbomole
  `$coord` in bohr);
- the total energy in the closing summary, the HOMO-LUMO gap in its
  SUMMARY, the orbitals it prints about the frontier, each atom's charges
  (GFN2-xTB's atomic partial charges, the q of its property printout;
  GFN1-xTB's Mulliken and CM5 charges) and the dipole moment (GFN2-xTB's "full" row,
  GFN1-xTB's "dipole moment from electron density", GFN-FF's from its
  charges) - each of the geometry it ended on, the last it printed;
- the dipole is taken about the origin of the coordinates xtb was given -
  so its real outputs have it: the q-only row is the charges' moment about
  that origin, of an optimised ion's final structure too - and is given
  with it (`origin`): where Meno takes it about is Meno's;
- the frequencies, reduced masses and IR intensities of its Frequency
  Printout; the thermochemistry of its Thermodynamic Functions and its
  THERMODYNAMIC summary, and how it was worked out;
- the solvation as its setup says it; an optimisation's outcome as it says
  it ("GEOMETRY OPTIMIZATION CONVERGED", "FAILED TO CONVERGE"); the
  imaginary frequencies it judged significant; its warnings; and how the
  run ended - "normal termination of xtb" and "abnormal termination of
  xtb" it writes to its other stream, so that an output of its own stream
  alone says how it ended by its own last lines ("* finished run on", or
  "[ERROR] Program stopped due to fatal error" and its numbered messages).
