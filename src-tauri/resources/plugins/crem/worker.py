"""The CReM plugin's worker: new structures made from seeds, for Meno's step
*Generate* (its manifest; docs/WORKFLOWS.md, *Kinds of step*), with CReM
(BSD-3-Clause; Polishchuk, J. Cheminform. 2020, 12, 28): each seed's
fragments replaced, or its hydrogens, by fragments found in the same
surroundings in a database of them, built from ChEMBL 33.

One JSON object per line on stdin, one per line back on stdout:

    {"id": 3, "op": "run", "step": "generate", "entries": [{"molblocks": [...]}], "options": {"operation": "mutate", "count": 20}}
    {"id": 3, "ok": true, "result": {"outputs": [...], "said": "...", "by": {...}}}
    {"id": 3, "ok": false, "error": "..."}

It runs no code it is sent - only the operation below - and reaches no
network: the fragment database is downloaded by Meno, with the user's
leave, into the folder given as this script's one argument, and unpacked
there (manifest.json, `downloads`).

    {"event": "ready", "version": "0.3.2"}

Each seed is a structure drawn, given as its MOL blocks, read as RDKit
reads them. CReM replaces a fragment of it (*Replace fragments*) - or a
hydrogen (*Add to it*) - by a fragment the database holds in the same
surroundings, `radius` bonds out: the larger the radius, the closer the
surroundings must match, and the fewer and more conservative the
structures. Where more are found than asked for, CReM picks those it makes
with the random seed given, so that the same asking gives the same ones.

Each goes back as CReM gives it, and nothing more is made of it here
(docs/PLUGINS.md, *Generate*): its SMILES; its values, named - the change
made (`change`, a reaction SMARTS as CReM writes it) and how many times the
fragment put in occurs in the database (`frequency`); which seed it was
made from, by its place among those given (`seed` beside them); and, for
each seed by its place, how many it made or why it was not read (`seeds`),
from which Meno names them. An option outside what it may be is refused,
never run as another. Nothing is made 3D, no stereo is enumerated, nothing
is refused or cut: the general steps after it do that, and Meno takes no
more from one run than it takes of any (docs/PLUGINS.md, *Generate*). A
seed RDKit cannot read is counted, with why.
