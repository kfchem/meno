"""ORCA's output, read into Meno's form (docs/PLUGINS.md, *The contract*; src/lib/calc/output.ts).

The ORCA plugin's own reading of what ORCA wrote: a job's output and a file opened by hand alike, one reading for
both. Written from the ORCA 6.1 manual (faccts.de) and from ORCA's own outputs - ORCA 6.1.1's, run on small
molecules for its tests (scripts/calc/test_reader_orca.py) - and from nothing else. Python alone, no package:
each function is given the text and gives back plain data; nothing here reads a file of its own choosing.

What it gives, in Meno's units: the atoms and each geometry ORCA wrote, in angstroms; each geometry's energy as
ORCA states it, in hartrees; what the calculation was - the program and its version, the method and basis set,
the solvation, the charge and multiplicity, each atom's mass; how the run went; and everything else as results in
the general form (src/lib/calc/results.ts). A value ORCA did not print is not read: none is worked out in its place.
