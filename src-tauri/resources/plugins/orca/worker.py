"""The ORCA plugin's worker: steps of a workflow done with ORCA.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/WORKFLOWS.md), run in an
environment of its own - Python alone, no package. ORCA itself is a
program installed separately, under its own licence: never fetched or
shipped by Meno, found where the system finds programs or where the
chemist located it (the manifest's `installed`). One JSON object per line
each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "orca", "args": ["input.inp"], "files": [...],
        "then": [{"program": "orca_2mkl", "args": ["input", "-molden"]}], "reads": ["input.molden.input"]}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {...}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"read": [{"kind": "orca", "log": true, "name": "water.out",
        "wavefunction": {"kind": "molden", "file": "input.molden.input", "name": "water.molden"}}]}}
    {"id": 6, "op": "read", "kind": "orca", "name": "water.out", "text": "..."}
    {"id": 6, "ok": true, "result": {"schema": 1, "program": "ORCA", "atoms": [...], "frames": [...], ...}}

It fills three kinds of step - Optimise, Energy, Frequencies - and runs
nothing itself: `prepare` writes each job's input and says the command
Meno runs, apart from Meno, in the job's folder; `collect` reads nothing
either, but says that what ORCA printed is ORCA's output, for Meno's
readers to read as one opened is - and, where the job kept it, that the
wavefunction is kept with the molecule, for a step that takes one
(Multiwfn's NCI) - or, where the job failed, why. One job for each entry.

The input is written as ORCA's own manual has it (ORCA 6.1 Manual,
faccts.de: "General Structure of the Input File", "Parallel and
Multi-Process Modules", "Implicit Solvation Models"), and from nothing
else:

- a simple input line, begun by "!": the method and basis set, a
  dispersion correction (D3BJ, D4), the run - SP, OPT or FREQ (NUMFREQ
  at ORCA's own xTB, which has no analytic Hessian: said on the step's
  line) - and, for implicit solvation, CPCM(solvent) or SMD(solvent). What is typed into
  it - the method, the basis set, the keywords - stays on that line, with
  no "#", which begins a comment, and no "%", which begins a block: the
  manual names a file or a program only in a block, in quotes (%MOInp
  "file", %method ProgExt "path"), so a step's text names neither - a
  workspace's steps may come from someone else, and run where it is
  opened;
- %pal nprocs, the processes a run uses, where it may use more than one;
  %maxcore, the memory for each, in MB;
- the coordinates, "* xyz charge multiplicity", an atom a line - its
  element and x, y, z in angstroms, and an isotope's mass after them,
  "M = 2.01410177812" ("Coordinate input": non-standard isotopes are
  "specified with the statements M = ... after the atomic coordinate
  definition"), the mass Meno gives with the entry (NIST's) - and "*" at
  their end.

A lone atom - an ion of a salt, say - asked to be optimised is run as SP:
it has no geometry to optimise, and ORCA, given OPT for one atom, warns
and stops with no energy. It comes back where it was, with its energy.

ORCA is run as the manual says: by its full path, given the input file,
printing its output. To keep the wavefunction, the job then runs
orca_2mkl, installed beside ORCA, as the manual's "orca_2mkl" has it:
`orca_2mkl BaseName -molden`, writing ORCA's orbitals (BaseName.gbw) in
Molden's format - which it names BaseName.molden.input.

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
