"""The Multiwfn interface's worker: non-covalent interactions, worked out by Multiwfn from a wavefunction or the geometry alone.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/NCI.md), run in an environment of
its own - Python alone, no package. Multiwfn itself is a program installed
separately, under its own licence: never fetched or shipped by Meno, found
where the system finds programs or where the chemist located it (the
manifest's `installed`), and run apart from Meno. One JSON object per line
each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "nci", "entries": [{..., "files": [{"kind": "molden", "name": "water.molden", "text": "..."}]}], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "multiwfn", "args": ["wavefunction.molden", "-nt", "4", "-silent"], "files": [...], "stdin": "nci.txt", "reads": ["nci.txt"]}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "nci", ...}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"surfaces": [{"name": "Non-covalent interactions", "rows": [...]}]}}

It fills the kind of step NCI from a calculation's wavefunction - a
Molden file, a Gaussian formatted checkpoint, a WFN or a WFX - each entry
given the one its molecule was read from (the step's `files`, joined to
the plugin that read it by the kind's id alone); and, for a molecule read
from none - or where the promolecular density is asked for - from its
geometry alone: Multiwfn sums its atoms' free densities, built into it
(the promolecular density), so that nothing else is needed. It runs
nothing itself: `prepare` writes the wavefunction under a name whose
extension tells Multiwfn what it is, or the geometry as an XYZ file, and
what Multiwfn is to be told, a line at a time - read back after the run
(`reads`), so that `collect` knows which density each entry's surface is
of; `collect` says which of the cube files Multiwfn wrote is the surface
and which colours it, for Meno to read (lib/calc/cube) - or why it failed.

What Multiwfn is told is as its own manual has it (Multiwfn 2026.10.1
manual, sobereva.com: 2.2 "Supported arguments", 3.23.1 "Noncovalent
interaction (NCI) analysis", 3.23.2 "NCI analysis based on promolecular
density", 5.2 "Running Multiwfn in silent mode"), and from nothing else:
run with the wavefunction's file or the XYZ file, its threads (-nt) and no
window (-silent), it reads from its standard input

    20   Visual study of weak interaction
    1    NCI analysis - or 2, NCI analysis based on promolecular density,
         "all operation steps ... completely identical" (3.23.2)
    n    the grid: 1 low, 2 medium, 3 high quality, covering the whole system
    3    output the cube files: func1.cub, sign(λ2)ρ; func2.cub, the RDG
    0    back
    0    back to the main menu
    q    quit

Where the promolecular density is used, Multiwfn sets the RDG to 100
where the density is above 0.1 a.u. (its settings.ini's
RDGprodens_maxrho), and a surface is drawn at RDG 0.3 by default, as its
manual's promolecular example has it (4.20.2).

Multiwfnpath names the folder its settings.ini is in (the manifest's
`env`): where Multiwfn is.

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
