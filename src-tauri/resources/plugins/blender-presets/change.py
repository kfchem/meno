"""A change of molecules (docs/plugins/blender-presets.md, *A motion*): a film in pieces, one for each molecule that becomes
the next - A, the piece's molecule, staged by the kit (motionkit.py), into B, the next. Executed after the kit, in its
namespace, by motion_kit.py `change`, before the change's own `keyed()`.

CFG adds: next (B's index among Meno's molecules: the kit gives it as NEXT_ATOMS and NEXT_BONDS), t_offset (where the piece
starts in the film, in seconds), t_total (the film's length) and loop (whether the film comes back to its first molecule).
Every molecule stands on the same floor (the kit's `stand`), turned as the canvas shows it. Who goes where in a change
(`hungarian`) is the change's choreography: which grain flies to which place, never a mapping of the molecules.
