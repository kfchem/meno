"""The PySCF plugin's worker: a Molden file's orbitals and densities, on a grid.

A reader plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md), run in a pixi environment of
its own, PySCF from conda-forge. One JSON object per line each way, as
every reader's:

    {"id": 7, "op": "read", "name": "job.molden", "text": "..."}
    {"id": 8, "op": "ask", "key": "orbital:0:34", "name": "job.molden", "text": "..."}
    {"id": 7, "ok": true, "result": {...}}

A plugin of its own, sharing no code with any other (the maintainer,
2026-10-06): it reads a Molden file with PySCF's own reader
(`pyscf.tools.molden.load`) and gives its molecule - its atoms and their
places, as PySCF reads them - and its orbitals and densities. The format
holds no charge or multiplicity, so it says neither. Its orbitals, in
Meno's general form (each its spin, energy in hartrees, occupation and
symmetry, as PySCF reads them, all of them - Meno lists them), carry each
orbital's surface, and a list of densities theirs, as promises (Meno's
`{"ask": key}`): asked for, the values are worked out on the grid Meno's
request gives (its `grid`), from the file sent again, nothing kept
between. Before any surface is promised,
the orbitals are checked as PySCF reads them - orthonormal in their basis -
so that none is drawn from a basis read wrong.

PySCF is used as a library; none of its code is Meno's.
