"""The NCIPLOT interface's worker: non-covalent interactions, worked out by NCIPLOT 4.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/NCI.md), run in an environment of
its own - Python alone, no package. NCIPLOT itself is a program installed
separately, under its own licence (the GPL): never fetched or shipped by
Meno, found where the system finds programs or where the chemist located
it (the manifest's `installed`), and run apart from Meno. One JSON object
per line each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "nci", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "nciplot", "args": ["input.nci"], "files": [...], "reads": []}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "nci", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"surfaces": [{"name": "Non-covalent interactions", "rows": [...]}]}}

It fills the kind of step NCI, and runs nothing itself: `prepare` writes
each entry's geometry as an XYZ file - or, asked for interactions between
molecules alone, each of the entry's fragments (the molecules Meno says
its bonds make: docs/PLUGINS.md, *The entry a plugin is given*) in a file
of its own - and NCIPLOT's input; `collect` says which of the cube files
NCIPLOT wrote is the surface and which colours it, for Meno to read
(lib/calc/cube) - or, where the job failed, why. One job for each entry.

The input is written as NCIPLOT 4's own manual has it (NCIPLOT-4.2,
NCIPLOT_MANUAL.pdf, "The input" and "The output"), and from nothing else:

- the number of files to read, and each file's name, a line each: XYZ
  files, for the promolecular density NCIPLOT works with from a geometry;
- ONAME, the name its output files go by (in capitals): NCI;
- OUTPUT 2, its cube files alone: NCI-grad.cube, the reduced density
  gradient (RDG), and NCI-dens.cube, sign(λ2)ρ × 100;
- COARSE or FINE, its grids and their steps, or neither (0.1 Å);
- INTERMOLECULAR, where only interactions between the files' molecules
  are wanted;
- CUTPLOT, the density beyond which the cubes leave the RDG out (0.07 a.u.
  in the promolecular case, as the manual's default), and the RDG a
  surface is drawn at.

NCIPLOT is run as its README says: given its input, with NCIPLOT_HOME
naming its folder (the manifest's `env`) and OMP_NUM_THREADS its threads
(Meno sets them).

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
